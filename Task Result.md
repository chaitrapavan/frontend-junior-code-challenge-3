## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

* I used HTML to create a static web page
* I used CSS to style the HTML elements
* I used Javascript to create and handle the events on the DOM. For example, submit, doubleclick and click events. Also to create
  the grids dynamically. Javascript is the best frontend web technology to interact with the web apge or DOM.
